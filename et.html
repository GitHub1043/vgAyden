Atari E.T. beagan development in July 1982 when Atari bought the video game rights to Steven Spielberg's new movie E.T. Howard Warshaw was in charge of programming the game. One day Warshaw was sitting in his office when he got a call from the Atari CEO, Raymond Kasser. Kasser said to Howard that they needed the game done by September 1st, leaving 5 weeks to make it. Warshaw said in an interview "That left five weeks to do it! Normally it'd be six to eight months to do a game, not five weeks. Then he said, Design the game and on Thursday morning, be at the airport and there will be a Learjet waiting to take you to see Spielberg."<p> His idea was an adventure game where the player had to help E.T. phone home by collecting components to make an telephone. The player would have to dodge government agents and scientists in order to complete the mission. Speilberg said to Warshaw "Couldn't you do something more like Pac-Man?"<p> When E.T. got released it was one of the top selling games, but Atari soon realised that ET was not meeting expectations. From there the game just went downhill
