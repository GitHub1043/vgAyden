<p><h3><span style=' color: White'>What is the PlayStation</span></h3>
The PlayStation was Sony's first game console. It was released in Japan on December 3rd, 1994 and in North America on September 9th, 1995. The PlayStation had a screen resolution of 256 x 224 - 640 x 480, an Operating System Memory of 512K, Main Memory of 2MB, Video Memory of 1MB, and Sound Memory of 512K. The first version of the console represented a significant improvement in terms of graphic quality over the existing cartridge players of the 1990's.

<p><h3><span style=' color: White'>Competition at the Time</span></h3>
When the PlayStation came out in 1995 the Sega Saturn had been out for about 4 months. Nintendo hadn't came out with the N64 yet but when it did, that was Sony's main competition.

<p><h3><span style=' color: White'>The Effect of the PlayStation</span></h3>
The PlayStation changed the gaming world in many ways like eliminating game cartridges and giving dual thumbsticks. Back when the PlayStation came out no game console had dual tumbsticks, not even the PlayStation. it wasnt until April 25th, 1997 that they had the idea to make a controller with 2 analog sticks. In 1999 Ape Escape became the first game to be designed for dual analog sticks. another thing it revolutionized was getting rid of game cartridges. At the time most game consoles used cartridges but when the PlayStation came out they decided to use discs instead leading to the elimination of the game cartridge.
